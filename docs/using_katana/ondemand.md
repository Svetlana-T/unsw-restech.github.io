title: Katana OnDemand

There are a number of GUI based software packages that are offered through a web interface. The requirements are a Katana account and for the user to be either on campus or connected to the [UNSW VPN](https://vpn.unsw.edu.au).

These can be accessed from [https://kod.restech.unsw.edu.au](https://kod.restech.unsw.edu.au)

After logging in, you can:

- Access your `/home/`, `/srv/scratch/` and any project files from the Files menu. While you can upload files through this interface, please don't upload anything larger than about 10MB. 

- See your active jobs in a web based view of the traditional `qstat` command

- Start a new interactive app


Installed interactive apps are availble in a drop-down list
